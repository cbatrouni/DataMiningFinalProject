Welcome to our Data Mining Final Project!

Our project was written in Python through Jupyter Notebook (using Kaggle).
Due to the way Jupyter Notebook Python files work, we have used Kaggle to run the project.
If the grader wishes to run the programs themselves, we have created a Kaggle account and will
list the instructions below. However, we also have a github (link provided below) that
contains all the code (as .ipynb files) and it displays the results in each file. 


*
*
*GITHUB
*
*
Github link: https://github.com/cbatrouni/DataMiningFinalProject

Within the Github, it contains a folder named "Final Project Code" and pdf on the report.
To view the code:
1) Open the "Final Project Code" folder.
2) Click either of the two files and they will be presented on your screen.

In each file:
- "Ensemble_Including_RF_LR_NB.ipynb" contains our ensemble model that uses
Random Forest, Logistical Regression, and Naive Bayes.

- "final-project-nb.ipynb" contains our Naive Bayes model that is solely used
on the data set.

*HOW TO RUN

* 

*VIDEO WILL BE INCLUDED*

Instructions how to run:
1) Visit https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?phase=startSignInTab&returnUrl=%2F

2) Click: "Sign in with your email"

3) Enter in the log in credentials:
   Username: cbatrouni@fordham.edu
   Password: datamine22LC
  
3.5) Once logged in, (in the same browser you are currently using) visit link: https://www.kaggle.com/dataminefclcgrader/code
   

IF STEP 3.5 DOES NOT WORK, FOLLOW STEPS 4-6, else disregard 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) On the top right corner of the screen, click the profile picture.
5) After clicking, a side panel will open on the right. Click "Your Profile".
6) Once on the profile page, click "Code"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7) Once on the code page, there will be two programs: "Final Project NB" and "FinalProject RF, LR, and NB"
   - Final Project NB - Naive Bayes model that is solely used on the data set.
   - FinalProject RF, LR, and NB - contains our ensemble model that uses Random Forest, 
        Logistical Regression, and Naive Bayes.

8) Clicking either of the programs will bring you to a page that displays the code and their results per cell.

9) If you wish to run it, on the top right click the "Edit" button. This will bring you to the edit screen.

10) Once in the edit screen, click the "Run All" button at the top. Depending on the program, it may take
    longer to finish running. A few moments after clicking "Run All", the button will turn to a red "Cancel Run" button.
	At this stage, let the program run fully until the "Cancel Run" button has turned back to "Run All".
	
	
11) Each code cell will display their results directly below the cell.
